Meridian is a design framework for creating overview-detail interfaces (ODIs) that are malleable by default. Traditionally, designers and developers build interfaces using their respective tools, but this separation makes it difficult to transfer designs across teams. At the same time, this process often excludes end-users from personalizing the very interfaces intended for them. Meridian introduces a specification language for ODIs that integrates with developer packages, UI design tools, and end-user interfaces—enabling all three groups to equally establish interface needs.
